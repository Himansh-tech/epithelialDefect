# Epithelial Defect Measurement 👁️  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on detecting and measuring **epithelial defects** in eye images using **deep learning** and **image processing** techniques.  
The primary goal is to assist ophthalmologists by providing automated and accurate measurements of corneal epithelial defects, which are critical in diagnosing and tracking ocular diseases.
